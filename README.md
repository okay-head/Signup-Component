[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/4cc745ea-b285-40af-aa00-122d8844e963/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/gentle-froyo-74b6f1/deploys)

> Form validation is a crucial component in an app. This mini project is an attempt to build a form using strict type checking and validation, adhering to the best practices throughout.

## Overview

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty.
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`).
  - Password is less than 8 characters
- **Checkbox for _T&C_: Form will not submit without checking this box first.**

## My process

- Created a figma file out of the images provided
- Designed my markup desktop-first
- Added CSS mobile-first
- Refactored, documented and all over again
- Tracked my time throughout

### Technologies used

- **[React](https://react.dev/)** - for composable spaghetti code
- **[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** - type safety at the cost of headache
- **[Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)** - for ugly HTML
- **[Tailwind/forms](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-forms)** - for resets
- **[React hook form](https://react-hook-form.com/)** - form states, performance, errors
- **[Zod](https://zod.dev/)** - schema resolver, form validator
- **[Prettier](https://prettier.io/)** - tabs or spaces? pnpm format
- **[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)** - low disk space? say no more

### What I learned

- Documenting your code.
- Type-safety is underrated.
- Zod as a schema resolver makes the code a little more structured.
- Making projects and refining them on your own without deadlines is bliss.

### Continued development

This project is close to complete.

Continued development will primarily involve code refactoring.

### Useful resources

- [Bytegrad](https://youtu.be/AeQ3f4zmSMs) - The why and how of zod: the schema validation library

- [Rhf documentation](https://react-hook-form.com/) is top notch. Kudos to the team

- [Vite docs](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html) - There's more to your quiet and efficient build tool

- [Avoid spaghetti code](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ) - #1 resource for best practices
